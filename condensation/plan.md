# Patent Condensation Pipeline - Development Plan

## Overview
Build a systematic pipeline to condense patent documents by removing redundancy and legalese while preserving all technical information and legal claims. Target: Process 100K+ patents efficiently with variable compression ratios (1.5x-10x).

## Core Principle
**Information-preserving compression** - Every technical detail and legal claim must remain intact while removing verbose, redundant, and boilerplate content. Therefore, improving the quality of the condensed patent for downstream tasks is a priority.

## Phase 0: Setup (Weeks 0-1)

### 0.1 Create Patent Corpus

Initial corpus:
- 10k utility patents
  - 5k USPTO
  - 5k EP

> Reasoning: Familiarity with USPTO and EP formats, availability of patents, and ease of access.

## Phase 1: Research & Baseline (Weeks 1-3)

### 1.1 Corpus Analysis
- Collect 10K utility patents for analysis
- Identify common boilerplate patterns and phrases
- Map standard patent document structures
- Quantify redundancy levels across different patent types

### 1.2 Ground Truth Creation
- Manually annotate 100-500 patents with importance labels
- Mark: essential sentences, redundant content, pure boilerplate
- Create evaluation dataset with before/after examples
- Generate synthetic training data using GPT-4/5

### 1.3 Baseline Methods
- Implement simple extractive approaches (TextRank, LexRank)
- Test claim-similarity scoring
- Build rule-based boilerplate detector
- Establish performance baselines and speed benchmarks

## Phase 2: Pipeline Development (Weeks 4-8)

### 2.1 Rule-Based Preprocessing
- Build fast boilerplate removal filters
- Implement section detection and classification
- Create pattern-based redundancy detection
- Target: 20-30% reduction with zero information loss

### 2.2 Importance Scoring System
- Compare multiple scoring approaches scientifically
- Test: position-based, claim-similarity, technical density
- Combine signals through learned weights
- Validate against human annotations

### 2.3 Model Selection
- Evaluate architectures for patent-specific requirements
- Compare: RoBERTa (classification), T5 (condensation), LED (long documents)
- Test extractive vs abstractive approaches
- Consider multi-stage vs single-model architectures

### 2.4 Information Preservation
- Develop metrics for measuring information retention
- Implement claim reconstruction tests
- Create technical term coverage analysis
- Build validation pipeline for legal accuracy

## Phase 3: Implementation (Weeks 9-12)

### 3.1 Training Pipeline
- Generate large-scale synthetic training data
- Implement multi-objective training (compression + preservation)
- Fine-tune selected models on patent corpus
- Optimize for variable compression ratios

### 3.2 Batch Processing Optimization
- Implement efficient batching strategies
- Add quantization and pruning for speed
- Build parallel processing pipeline
- Target: 1000+ patents/hour on single GPU

### 3.3 Quality Assurance
- Automated verification of claim preservation
- Technical accuracy checking
- Compression ratio monitoring
- Error detection and logging

## Phase 4: Evaluation & Iteration (Weeks 13-16)

### 4.1 Systematic Testing
- Ablation studies on pipeline components
- Compare against baselines
- Measure speed/quality tradeoffs
- Test on diverse patent categories

### 4.2 Output Format Design
- Determine optimal structure (keep original vs reorganize)
- Implement structured output generation
- Build format conversion tools
- Create readable condensed patent format

### 4.3 Production Preparation
- Scale testing to 10K+ patents
- Optimize for production hardware
- Build monitoring and logging
- Create deployment documentation

## Key Experiments to Run

1. **Boilerplate Detection Accuracy**
  - How much can rule-based filtering compress?
  - What patterns are universal vs domain-specific?

2. **Importance Scoring Comparison**
  - Which signals best predict human importance labels?
  - How do neural models compare to statistical approaches?

3. **Information Preservation Tests**
  - Can we reconstruct claims from condensed text?
  - Do downstream tasks work on condensed patents?

4. **Architecture Comparison**
  - Extractive vs abstractive performance
  - Single model vs pipeline efficiency
  - Long-context models vs chunking strategies

## Success Metrics

- **Compression**: 2-5x average reduction
- **Speed**: 1000+ patents/hour minimum
- **Accuracy**: 100% claim preservation, 95%+ technical term retention
- **Quality**: Human evaluation confirms no critical information loss

## Risk Mitigation

- Start with rule-based approaches for immediate value
- Keep human in the loop for quality validation
- Build reversible condensation where possible
- Maintain audit trail of what was removed

## Next Steps

1. Begin corpus collection and analysis
2. Build boilerplate detection prototype
3. Create manual annotation guidelines
4. Set up evaluation framework
5. Start baseline implementation

## Tools & Resources Needed

- GPU compute for model training (single GPU acceptable initially)
- Patent corpus access (USPTO, Google Patents)
- Annotation tools for ground truth creation
- GPT-4/5 API access for synthetic data generation
- Evaluation metrics implementation

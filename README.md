## Datasets

Open Patent provides a set of datasets that can be used to train machine learning models.  The datasets have been collated from various EPO publication server a
nd patents views, and are available for download.  In addition, to the raw datasets, we ahave also generated a number of synthetic datasets that can be used to train machine learning models.
